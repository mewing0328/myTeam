[Link for demo video]() (Length of video: x minutes and x seconds)

Video is also within the assets folder named "x".

A walkthrough video that demonstrates: 
- the functionality of the myTeam generator.
- how a user would invoke the application from the command line.
- how a user would enter responses to all of the prompts in the application.
- the application pushes employee cards into the [HTML file](./dist/index.html) and applies the [CSS](./dist/style.css) styling to those cards.

-------- NOTES FOR REQUIREMENTS -------------

            ## Acceptance Criteria

            ```md
            GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
            WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information
            THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input
            WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML
            THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
            WHEN I click on the GitHub username
            THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
            WHEN I start the application
            THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
            WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
            THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team
            WHEN I select the engineer option
            THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
            WHEN I select the intern option
            THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu
